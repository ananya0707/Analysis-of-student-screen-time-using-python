#  Screen Time & Health Analysis (Python)

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between screen time and health indicators among youth. Using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), I cleaned and analyzed a dataset to uncover behavioral patterns and visualize key insights.

## Objectives
- Clean and structure raw survey data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends across age, gender, and device usage
- Identify screen time exceeding recommended limits

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed nulls and duplicates
   - Standardized column names
   - Split multi-label columns (e.g., device usage)
2. **EDA**
   - Summary statistics by age and gender
   - Distribution plots of screen time
   - Correlation matrix for health indicators
3. **Visualization**
   - Bar charts for device usage
   - Line plots for age vs screen time
   - Gender comparison using grouped bar charts
   - Highlighted % exceeding screen time limits

## Key Insights
- Smartphone is the most used device across all age groups
- Ages 16â€“17 show the highest average screen time
- Females slightly exceed males in daily screen time
- Over 60% of participants exceed recommended screen time
